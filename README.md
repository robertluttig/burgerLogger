# burgerLogger
This app let's a user log different burger types

This is a burger logger using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Using the MVC design pattern; Node and MySQL were used to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.

Burger Logger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat or have eaten.


Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the  app will display the burger onthe page -- waiting to be devoured.
(This function currently doesn't work, right now you can only move burgers to devoured or not devoured that are only in the database)
